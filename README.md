## pd-shuffle
Improved [shuffle ] object for [Pure Data](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) - a free real-time computer music system. 

### Overview

This is a drop-in replacement for the object of the same name in the [Motex library](https://puredata.info/downloads/motex) by Iain Mott, which can crash and uses an inefficient shuffle algorithm. It is rewritten from scratch using proper memory allocation and the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm.

### Description

[shuffle ] outputs all of the integers in a specified range in random order without repeating any, then reshuffles. Inputs are described in the following table:

| Selector | Input   | Type    | Action                                |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| **bang**     | 0       | active  | output next integer in the series |
| **lower**    | 0       | active  | update lower bound of range, trigger reset/reshuffle |
| **upper**    | 1       | passive | update upper bound of range |
| **fraction** | 2       | passive | update **fraction** (0 <= **fraction** <= 0.5) - if nonzero, ensures that the last fraction of the series is not repeated at the beginning of the next series |

note: **upper** and **fraction** inputs take effect when **lower** is input

### Installation

The shuffle.c file can be compiled into a Pure Data external using [pure-data/pd-lib-builder](https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder). Simply place the linked file (e.g. shuffle.pd_linux) along with the help patch shuffle-help.pd into the same directory as your patch, or somewhere on the Pd search path (e.g., externals/shuffle folder).
